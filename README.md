# 👋 Hi, I’m @svdmeer27 - Sophie van der Meer

- 👀 I’m interested in exploring blockchain metaverses, low-level coding, and innovative tech ecosystems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning generative AI and ways to integrate it into the full-stack development process—from ideation and art to code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating immersive metaverse experiences and pushing the boundaries of digital spaces.
- 📫 How to reach me: [svdmeer27@gmail.com](mailto:svdmeer27@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fascinated by the intersection of art and code and enjoy crafting visual worlds as much as building the tech behind them!
